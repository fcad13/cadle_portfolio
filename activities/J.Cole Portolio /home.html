            <h2>Jermaine Cole</h2>
            <p>Jermaine Lamarr Cole (born January 28, 1985) is a German-born American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Cole is regarded as one of the most influential rappers of his generation.[4] Born on a military base in Germany and raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina,[5] Cole initially gained recognition as a rapper following the release of his debut mixtape, The Come Up, in early 2007. Intent on further pursuing a musical career, he went on to release two additional mixtapes, The Warm Up (2009) and Friday Night Lights (2010) both to critical acclaim, after signing to Jay-Z's Roc Nation imprint in 2009.
